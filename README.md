Installing JBoss EAP 6.2 in domain mode over an OpenNebula
4.4.0 Cluster

The aim of this tutorial is to teach you how to properly install a JBoss EAP cluster over several
VMs handled by OpenNebula.
Every part of this software needs to be very well configured in order to work properly. Thus we
wanted to write down every single step we faced.

This document has been written by many authors while working on the configuration. Therefore
it can result messy and grammatically incorrect. We will try to review this document as best
we can. By the way the future readers/authors of this document that want to help us are more
than welcome.
